## This is an example Apache .htaccess file that can be used to add the required
## Content-Encoding: header to the compressed version of the ExCanvas library.
## This .htaccess file is ONLY required for the compressed version. The
## necessary header is this:
##                           Content-Encoding: gzip
##
## If you are not using the compressed version, or are doing the compression
## yourself (it could for example, be built into  your web server), then you
## do not need this file.
